    "text": "Wildfires are increasing in size, frequency, and severity.\nIn the past 50 years, the extreme increase in wildfires in the western US has become highly concerning for local human and environmental communities. There are 4 key trends with this increase:\n\nFires are increasing in number each year\nFires are becoming more severe (faster spreading, hotter flame temperatures, more erratic behavior)\nThe same areas are burning over and over\nFires are getting bigger\n\nBelow is a graph that shows the average size of all wildfires each month in the contiguous United States (lower 48) from 2000 - 2023. Along with showing this size increase over time (represented by the blue trend line), we can also see the seasonality of wildfires. Larger fires tend to occur in the summer whereas smaller fires occur in the winter.\n\nIn order to analyze the reasons for this increase, we need to understand where and how these wildfires are happening. Looking at characteristics of recent US wildfires wildfires will begin to give us a sense of the scope of this modern natural disaster."

Toggle with the sliders and drop downs to explore different traits of these wildfires yourself and click on an individual point to see fire details.\n\n\nWe can see many trends from this map. For example, medium and large fires are most common in the western United States. Wildfire started by lightning appear to be more clustered in mountainous regions of the west. We can also see that fires which impact more buildings tend to be costlier. We will explore some of the reasons for these trends in the upcoming pages."
