    "text": "Wildfires are increasing in size, frequency, and severity.\nIn the past 50 years, the extreme increase in wildfires in the western US has become highly concerning for local human and environmental communities. There are 4 key trends with this increase:\n\nFires are increasing in number each year\nFires are becoming more severe (faster spreading, hotter flame temperatures, more erratic behavior)\nThe same areas are burning over and over\nFires are getting bigger\n\nBelow is a graph that shows the average size of all wildfires each month in the contiguous United States (lower 48) from 2000 - 2023. Along with showing this size increase over time (represented by the blue trend line), we can also see the seasonality of wildfires. Larger fires tend to occur in the summer whereas smaller fires occur in the winter.\n\n\n\nAverage size of wildfires in the contiguous United States by month (2000-2024) (NOAA)\n\n\nIn order to analyze the reasons for this increase, we need to understand where and how these wildfires are happening. Looking at characteristics of recent US wildfires wildfires will begin to give us a sense of the scope of this modern natural disaster."

For example, medium and large fires are most common in the western United States. Wildfire started by lightning appear to be more clustered in mountainous regions of the west. We can also see that fires which impact more buildings tend to be costlier. We will explore some of the reasons for these trends in the upcoming pages."

Unless something major is done to halt the speed of global climate change, the impacts of larger, more severe, and more frequent wildfires will become increasingly extensive. In 2025, with the Trump administration in the White House, progress toward climate mitigation has already been reversing with major cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). These cuts are happening at a time when communities will only need more resources to change and adapt to the increased threat of fire. Adaptations might include preparing evacuation routes, establishing community support for those in need, shifting towards fire conscious building practices, reducing expansion into wildland areas, increasing controlled and indigenous cultural burns, ramping up emergency firefighting networks, and expanding social services. The societal and environmental impacts of wildfires will only continue to grow in scope and destructiveness if no action is taken in favor of sustainable wildfire management and climate mitigation.\nThere is no easy fix for increasing wildfires.

More recent estimates put this number at up to 85%.\n\n\n\nCause proportions of United States wildfires from FEMA reports (2014-2017)\n\n\nNatural Cause: Lightning\nWildfires started by lightning mostly occur in “wildland” defined as land that has not been developed. Extreme weather like high heat, low humidity, and high winds lead to perfect conditions for “dry lightning”, lightning with no rain. These are also prime conditions for wildfire spread. Most wildland fires in the western US occur in the the summer when heat is high, rain is minimal, and dry vegetation is abundant.\nHuman Causes\nThe most common human causes of wildfires are industrial equipment malfunctions, discarded cigarettes, arson, uncontrolled prescribed burns, unattended campfires or burning debris, and vehicles."

    "text": "How have humans contributed to this increase?\n\nHistorical Wildfire (Mis)Management\nMost Indigenous Peoples of North America utilized frequent controlled fires for land and pest management which were critical for ecosystem health. These cultural burning practices were outlawed with settler colonialism and replaced with total wildfire suppression with the goals of preventing all wildfires and stopping their spread as quickly as possible. This directly led to the “wildfire paradox”, the fact that when more small fires are suppressed, dry fuel builds up ultimately leading to bigger fires. Now, the USDA Forest Service has adopted a “let burn” policy for small fires, but the policies of the past and and present still contribute negatively to today’s wildfires.\nIncreased Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)\nHuman civilizations continue to rapidly encroach on undeveloped areas leading to an increase in the “Wildland-Urban Interface,” or the area where human-made life intermixes with wildland. This increases the risk of human-caused sparks igniting larger forest fires, poses unique challenges for firefighters, and means even small fires risk thousands of livelihoods.\nExplore the map below. This shows wildfire risk to homes in the top 10 riskiest states in the US. You can compare the populations of individual counties to their risk to see how many people are being affected. This expansion of the Wildland-Urban Interface means that millions of homes in the US are directly at risk.\n\n\nClick on a county or past wildfire to see the details. Past wildfire events are clustered in riskier areas. Also, wildfires that impacted more buildings are clustered in areas with higher populations.\nClimate Change\nThe greatest contributor to increasing wildfires is climate change from fossil fuel emissions. This has led to warmer average temperatures and more frequent droughts and heat waves, ideal conditions for longer, hotter, and more destructive wildfires. It also contributes to the climate-fire feedback loop: more fossil fuel emissions mean a warmer planet leading to more wildfires contributing more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Global Forest Watch\n\n\nNow that we know some of the main causes of increased wildfires, let’s look at its major effects."
